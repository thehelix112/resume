To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for the C++ Software Engineer position
advertised on Dice.com.  I believe I match the job description
perfectly.  I have recently finished my doctoral degree in computer
science, and I have been involved in several industrial C++ software
engineering projects.  These projects involved modelling and
simulation for the Australian Defence Force, and were built using
standardised object-oriented analysis and design.

I am a highly motivated self-learner and have excellent
communication skills: I have lectured a Masters course in C# and .NET,
and have tutored numerous other networking (including COM
technologies), database (primarily SQL) and programming courses.

Please find my resume attached for your consideration, and I look
forward to hearing back from you.

Yours Sincerely,

David Andrews
