\section{EXPERIENCE}
\noindent
{\bf Director of Development}, previously Sr. Software Engineer. \\ 
NeuralIQ Inc., Santa Monica, CA {\em (2006-present)} \\ 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Led the development team through 3 version releases, including
    incremental feature additions, as well as large architectural
    changes.  Strong emphasis on performance and stability as the
    software was deployed on appliances.
  \item Instituted and conducted bi-weekly workflow reviews to
    continuously iterate on and improve the development process.
  \item Project owner of a real-time hypervisor-based OS (Windows and
    Linux) data collection module (Patent Pending.)  This module
    collects information about any function call (kernel, syscall or
    userland) on 100\% unmodified guest OSs and is on-the-fly
    configurable.
  \item Project owner of a real-time OS analysis engine supported by a
    custom graph-based simulation database (Patent Pending).  This
    engine employs graph-based pattern matching to track OS behaviour
    through time.
  \item Project owner of a multi-threaded daemon responsible for
    serving individual and publish/subscribe requests for analysis
    data.
  \item Project owner of a dynamically-sizeable buffering library
    providing in-memory, and file-backed buffers for streaming
    data between threads or processes.
  \item Project owner of a file caching library designed for
    high-performance random access (\string~8x faster than {\em lseek() +
      read()}) and sequential writing (\string~2x faster than {\em
      write()}).
\end{itemize}
