Summary:
=====================================================
I love Google.

I have published:
  - 2 journal-level publications.
  - 4 conference papers.
I am hard working and thrive on challenging problems.
=====================================================

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for a Software Engineering position within your
company.  After appreciating and utilising impressive Google tools such
as `Scholar' and `Book' during my PhD candidature, I have decided that
I would love to be involved in the exciting future of Google, and in
the interesting challenges that await.

I believe I match the research scientist position you describe.  I
graduated at the top of my class from my Bachelor degree in 2002
(6.87/7 GPA) and my PhD dissertation is currently under examination.
My PhD candidature focused on modelling programs' (distributed
simulations) behaviour for intrusion prevention and detection.

Since before obtaining my Bachelors degree, I have been
internationally published, including two journal-level publications
for the Australian Defence Force, and numerous papers on the security
of military-oriented distributed simulations at conferences in Sweden,
USA and Australia. Please find below a list of these publications:

Security Architecture for the HLA. May, 2002 Simulation Technology and
Training Conference Proceedings.

A strong desire to publish meaningful material lead me to devote the
full period of my PhD candidature to research and development, mostly
devoid of publications.  I am currently in the process of writing and
submitting the outcomes from my doctoral studies for journal
publication in the future.

I have admired and been amazed by Google for years from Australia, and
since travelling to America, am keen to expand my horizons and be a
part of Google's cutting-edge developments.  I believe the skills in
critical analysis, motivation and self-teaching I have acquired during
my PhD candidature make me a valuable addition to Google.

I would love the opportunity to discuss my ideas for improvements to
existing Google tools as well as new developments. I attach my resume
for your consideration and look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

David Andrews
